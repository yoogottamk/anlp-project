mr president, the lack of implementation of environmental legislation is a serious problem.
mr president, poor compliance with environmental legislation is a huge problem.
---------------------------
the union is expanding and becoming more diverse.
the union is growing ever bigger and more diverse.
---------------------------
we must therefore establish rules that have existed in the various national cultures.
we must therefore lay down rules which can thrive in the different national cultures.
---------------------------
we should not therefore go into detail so much.
that is why i think we should prescribe less detail.
---------------------------
there is no need to apply any kind of flexibility on the path leading to this objective.
we do accept a certain degree of flexibility with regard to the method by which the result is achieved.
---------------------------
the habitats directive is an example of a sensible regulation.
an example of sound legislation is the habitats directive.
---------------------------
nature is a common heritage, and protecting nature is a common task.
the environment is a common legacy; environmental protection a common task.
---------------------------
the habitats directive sets out a clear objective.
the habitats directive prescribes a clear goal.
---------------------------
how to achieve this objective remains largely free to the member states.
the way in which it is to be achieved is quite flexible.
---------------------------
the implementation of the directive in remote and provinces naturally contains a considerable amount of conflict material
needless to say, there are many conflicts in villages and provinces with regard to the directive s application.
---------------------------
there are examples of directives that are not properly implemented.
there are instances of incorrect application.
---------------------------
the strength of the habitats directive is precisely in its flexibility.
the very strength of the habitats directive lies in its flexibility.
---------------------------
mrs jackson, thank you for asking this question.
i would like to thank mrs jackson for raising the question.
---------------------------
but what is happening?
but what do we see happening?
---------------------------
there are two camps.
two camps are forming.
---------------------------
on the one hand, the european union, which is looking at the shortcomings of the member states
on one side there is the european union, which seeks to blame the member states for shortcomings.
---------------------------
i can understand in part that you have acted in this way.
i can understand to an extent, why you took the line you did.
---------------------------
there are various causes for the problems of implementation.
there are various reasons as to why countries have trouble transposing this legislation.
---------------------------
this simply does not allow nature to be allowed to do so.
nature simply will not allow it.
---------------------------
but you do not know where it is going.
but basically, they do not know what is going on.
---------------------------
these are shortcomings that should be re-examined.
these are shortcomings that must be reviewed as a matter of priority.
---------------------------
speedy sanctions and careful drafting of laws can solve this problem.
speedier sanctions and careful drafting of laws will enable us to solve this problem.
---------------------------
i am very modest in my view, among other things, in the northern countries.
in all modesty, i am thinking, for example, of the nordic countries.
---------------------------
i believe, in any case, that parliament should support this work as fully as possible.
i think, at any rate, that parliament ought to provide as much support as possible for this work.
---------------------------
the member states have not implemented their own decisions, for example, in the habitats directive.
for example, the member states have not transposed the habitats directive into national legislation.
---------------------------
this also applies to many other legislation.
the same applies to a great deal of other legislation.
---------------------------
it is also, of course, about the quality of legislation that we need in the future.
and this is legislation which we need for the future.
---------------------------
it is therefore based on the information it gives the member states.
in doing so it, in turn, must rely on information supplied to it by the member states.
---------------------------
i would therefore like to ask the commission whether the current capacity is sufficient.
i should therefore like to ask the commission if it now has sufficient resources.
---------------------------
that means that all the parties involved must consider what they can do better.
in other words, we all have to think where we can make improvements.
---------------------------
i therefore ask you to support it.
i should therefore be grateful for your support.
---------------------------
finally, i would like to mention one point, namely the accession countries.
finally, i should like to mention one more point, namely the candidate countries.
---------------------------
we call for european legislation to be adopted by the countries that wish to join.
we require candidate countries to adopt european legislation.
---------------------------
it has been said that we should call the sunder.
some members are saying that we should name and shame.
---------------------------
we are wrongly accused of this.
we are being accused unfairly here.
---------------------------
this is the first step: the response to the commissions letters.
that is the first step: reply to the letters of the commission.
---------------------------
there must be no excuse for bad behaviour and doubtful behaviour by governments.
no government should be forgiven bad manners and inappropriate behaviour.
---------------------------
without success, perhaps even without a reply, i do not know.
no joy, no progress, perhaps even no response - i do not know.
---------------------------
this stock is a local sulphur pill.
this is on a local pilgrimage path.
---------------------------
the aim cannot be for people to withdraw completely.
finally, it must not be a case of the last person off the island turning the lights off.
---------------------------
we must live in these areas and earn our livelihood.
we have to live and earn a living in these places.
---------------------------
we could do more.
we could do more on that.
---------------------------
we could work more closely with indicators here, because we must measure that.
we could do more with the use of indicators because we have to measure.
---------------------------
we must improve the assessment of the results resulting from compliance with environmental legislation.
we have to be better at assessing the results of compliance with environmental legislation.
---------------------------
they must answer our questions and provide information.
they have to give us answers and provide us with information.
---------------------------
we cannot send inspectors to each member state.
we do not have the means to send people to all the member states to check.
---------------------------
we must modernise our right.
what we have to do is modernise legislation.
---------------------------
it has been noted in various ways that we need less, but better legislative proposals for this.
it has been said that we need less but better legislative proposals.
---------------------------
i agree with that.
i agree with that.
---------------------------
we must build on that.
we have to draw on that.
---------------------------
we can do more in the areas of education and information.
we can do more on education and information.
---------------------------
we have taken appropriate action.
we have started activities like this.
---------------------------
with all these instruments, we are trying to improve implementation.
we try to use all these available instruments to improve implementation.

however, i have not tried to reinvent the wheel.
i have, however, tried not to reinvent the wheel.
---------------------------
we live in an age of computer age.
we are living in a computer age.
---------------------------
we are now dealing very hard with food safety and production methods.
food safety measures and production methods are being thoroughly analysed these days.
---------------------------
organic farming plays an ever greater role across europe.
there is greater emphasis on organic production throughout europe.
---------------------------
the european agricultural economy is in a difficult economic situation.
the european agricultural industry is going through a difficult economic period with a great deal of restructuring going on at the same time.
---------------------------
at the same time, deep restructuring processes are taking place.
there is a great need to assist some of the older farmers to retire in dignity.
---------------------------
we must reverse this trend.
this trend must be reversed.
---------------------------
young farmers must be given greater access to production rights.
young farmers need greater access to production rights.
---------------------------
in many parts of the world, operating communities are normal practice.
in many parts of the world, share farming is a common practice.
---------------------------
the results have been slammed by some positive but even more negative aspects.
the results have been varied, with some positive aspects but with many other negative aspects.
---------------------------
and the difficult access to this is the main problem of young farmers.
the study also shows difficulty of access to land to be the main problem facing young farmers.
---------------------------
this effect is greatly exacerbated by the quota system and by the restrictions on production
this effect is significantly magnified by quota systems and by production-limiting schemes.
---------------------------
the thought of the mansholt plan was a good way to do this.
revisiting the mansholt plan would be a good place to start.
---------------------------
thank you very much.
many thanks indeed go to him, then.
---------------------------
i would just like to mention a few points in my brief speech.
in this short speech i would like to focus attention on a couple of points.
---------------------------
that is why so-called unity on one hundred hectares has become a problem.
the problem that has come about is what is referred to as the hundred-hectare solitude factor.
---------------------------
in agriculture, continuity is needed, especially in the face of the change in generations.
in agriculture we need sustainability, especially with regard to change-of-generation factors.
---------------------------
the average age of european farmers is worryingly high.
the average age of european farmers is worryingly high.
---------------------------
a change of generation must be economically possible.
it must be financially feasible to sustain the change-of-generation system.
---------------------------
it should be attractive for young people to become farmers.
young people must be induced to start farming.
---------------------------
yet there are not enough young farmers who are based on an agricultural company.
there are not enough young starters, however.
---------------------------
they can also use modern information technology in their planning.
similarly, they can make use of the latest information technology in their planning.
---------------------------
it is true that even in the island regions, very large areas of land are being demanded
the requirement for very large cultivated areas, even in island regions, is a typical example.
---------------------------
however, this condition is mutated into a ban in connection with quotas
this requirement becomes prohibitive when combined with quotas.
---------------------------
moral and financial support and training are important.
efforts must be concentrated on providing support - moral, educational and financial.
---------------------------
finally, the future of our rural communities depends on young farmers.
after all, young farmers hold the key to the future of all our rural communities.
---------------------------
in the uk, very few young people are putting their way into agriculture.
the lack of young people entering the agricultural industry in the uk is a very worrying problem.
---------------------------
unfortunately, this excellent programme has not been used by the british labour government.
yet the labour government in the uk has not taken advantage of this excellent scheme.
---------------------------
i therefore support the proposal to make eu-wide eu-wide 
i therefore fully support making installation aids mandatory across the european union.
---------------------------
young farmers are the future of the agricultural industry and they are only living in the communities.
young farmers are the future of the farming industry and vital components in urban communities.
---------------------------
how can we support them?
how can we help them?
---------------------------
finally, i would like to thank mr parish for his excellent work.
i would like to thank mr parish for his excellent work.
---------------------------
in fact, priority must be given to young farmers.
young farmers do indeed need urgent attention.
---------------------------
this is, in itself, a valuable contribution to agricultural policy.
this in itself constitutes a valuable contribution to agricultural policy.
---------------------------
it must take account of the framework conditions in terms of landscape and culture.
they need to give the landscape and cultural conditions due consideration.
---------------------------
we call this business activity, such as performance sports.
this is what we call social enterprising as a top-level sport.
---------------------------
entrepreneurial spirit, love for the environment and nature, social orientation and enforcement are encouraged.
it requires entrepreneurship, a love of nature and the environment, social orientation and perseverance.
---------------------------
we need motivated producers to do this.
this requires motivated producers.
---------------------------
food therefore means not only the market but also public health, agriculture and nature.
this means that food does not just stand for market forces, but also for public health, landscape and nature.
---------------------------
i think that a very constructive own-initiative report has been produced.
i think this is a very constructive own-initiative report.
---------------------------
the alarming figures should shock us.
the numbers alone should set our alarm bells ringing.
---------------------------
the number of farmers under 35 has fallen the most.
the biggest decrease has been in the number of farmers under the age of 35.
---------------------------
the traditional obligation to continue the hof in the subsequent generations is becoming increasingly rare.
the tradition of handing farms down from one generation to the next is disappearing.
---------------------------
what is left to the hof from the older generation is often still unresolved
the question of what becomes of the older generation left on the farm is often still unanswered.
---------------------------
what young people would like to justify their profession as farmers?
how many young people want to have to keep making excuses because they are farmers?
---------------------------
young farmers want fair prices for their products.
young farmers want fair prices for their products.
---------------------------
subsidies are not the reason why the decision is taken for this profession.
it is not because of the subsidies that they choose to be farmers.
---------------------------
the parish report can help to improve the image of young farmers as a whole.
the parish report may help to improve the overall image of young farmers.
---------------------------
agricultural services are being treated in a deep-seated manner in the public.
the public pays scant attention to the services of farming.
---------------------------
but it seems that bad messages are much better.
but apparently bad news makes better news.
---------------------------
at the moment, one reads every day about the current bse crisis.
at the moment, you can read about the current bse crisis blow by blow.
---------------------------
we have established standards.
we have set standards.
---------------------------
the so-called good practice has been continuously developed by our well-trained young farmers.
so-called good professional practice has been continually developed by our excellently trained young farmers.
---------------------------
that was the parish plan.
it was the parish plan.
---------------------------
nevertheless, this was certainly not an ideal situation.
however, we should not imagine that this was an ideal world in which to live.
---------------------------
we must not forget that.
we should not forget that.
---------------------------
without the common agricultural policy, this process would be very painful.
if it were not for the common agricultural policy, that would have been very painful.
---------------------------
today we need more quality and we need to take account of environmental concerns.
today we need more quality and we need to consider the environment.
---------------------------
mr parish has referred to all this.
all these are things mr parish has underlined.
---------------------------
mr president, first of all i should like to congratulate mr
mr president, could i begin by congratulating mr parish on bringing forward a very excellent report.
---------------------------
of course everyone is happy to say that we must help young farmers.
of course, everybody likes to say we must help the young farmers.
---------------------------
how do young people get to know them?
how can you encourage young people onto the land?
---------------------------
today, these young people have many other opportunities.
nowadays those young people have many other options open to them.
---------------------------
young farmers are working for very little money seven days a week.
but the young farmer will work seven days a week for very little money.
---------------------------
but if such a regulation is introduced, it is a binding regulation in all member
but, if you are going to bring this scheme in it has to be mandatory and it has to be introduced in every member state.
---------------------------
it is not enough to introduce them in only one member state.
it is not enough to introduce it in one member state alone.
---------------------------
we could support young farmers, who are still making bureaucracy very difficult at the moment
we could encourage young farmers, who face so much red tape and bureaucracy now.
---------------------------
young farmers have computers.
young farmers have computers.
---------------------------
that is the only way we can go further, because that is the future.
that is the way forward for the future.
---------------------------
this raises the question of what the european union can do.
all of this begs the question: what can the european union do?
---------------------------
i would like to say that we now need to do something about this.
but the point i want to make is that we need to do something now.
---------------------------
why should you decide for a life full of social hard work?
why should they face an anti-social life?
---------------------------
this is precisely the problem, and we must now address it.
that is the problem we have to address and we must address it now.

i would also like to thank the committee on agriculture and rural development for its work.

we cannot now subsidise huge amounts of additional money because there is no budgetary resources for
we cannot subsidise more huge quantities now because we do not have the funds.

i would like to mention two more points.
i have two other points.

firstly, do you think waste combustion is a renewable source of energy?
firstly, do you consider waste incineration a renewable energy, because we need clarification on that?

only the member states can decide whether nuclear power stations are being built.
it is for the member states to decide whether they will build or not build nuclear power plants.
---------------------------
will the commissioner dissociate himself from these statements?
will the commissioner disassociate herself from those comments?
---------------------------
secondly, waste is not renewable without further energy.
secondly, waste as such is not renewable energy.
---------------------------
the reverberation of waste itself cannot be renewable energy.
waste incineration by itself cannot be a renewable energy.
---------------------------
but if you think that you waste in itself, i will answer you with no.
but if you just say waste and that is all, then i will say no.
---------------------------
only from a certain angle and, of course, differing and sorting.
only waste considered in a particular way and, of course, specified and selected.

---------------------------
that is not what we can do.
things cannot go on like this.
---------------------------
point one: access to inland waters and inland waters.
my first point concerns access to waters and to internal resources.
---------------------------
the european union must take account of the continued activities of each fisheries community.
maintaining the traditional activities of every fishing community should be one of the european union s main concerns.
---------------------------
the principle of relative stability is a cornerstone of the common fisheries policy.

the commission should, in fact, directly involve the fisheries sector itself in preparing its
in my view, it is of utmost importance that the commission should actively involve the fisheries industry itself in the preparatory activities leading up to its decisions.
---------------------------
european fishermen are operating in very different waters.
european fishermen are active in very different waters.
---------------------------
that is why a regional approach is needed in accordance with the principle of subsidiar
this requires a regional approach which is entirely in compliance with the european union s principle of subsidiarity.
---------------------------
do all member states make appropriate use of the community funds spent on it?
do all member states benefit proportionately from spending community funding in this way?
---------------------------
i would like to ask you very much about this.
i doubt it very much.
---------------------------
too many fishermen are trying to catch the same species of fish.
too many fishermen are chasing too few fish.
---------------------------
the situation in the north sea is particularly worrying.
the situation in the north sea is of particular concern.

in december the council announced a drastic reduction in the total permitted prisons and

---------------------------
so many requests have been made to the commission.

---------------------------
i would just like to highlight three.
i should like to single out just three of these basic problems.
---------------------------
secondly, regionalisation is another slogan that is constantly generating controversy.
secondly: regionalisation is another catchword which repeatedly gives rise to controversial debate.
---------------------------
this is not a renationalisation that is, as always, a matter of
but regionalisation does not mean some form of renationalisation.
---------------------------
we have a common fisheries policy in the eu, and this will remain

only in this way can we strengthen the acceptance of the new cfp among the affected

mr president, the european unions fisheries policy is a major issue.
mr president, european union fisheries policy is a vast subject.

we must act as far as possible at an integrated level.
it is essential that we remain as integrated as possible.
---------------------------
proposals are also being made in other countries.
in other countries there are also suggestions.
---------------------------
that is what the debate can only benefit from.
this can only be good for debate.
---------------------------
the union must make considerable investments in this area.
europe should definitely invest in this.
---------------------------
the importance of the agreement with morocco was equally zero.
in the agreement with morocco they have had no weight whatsoever.
---------------------------
the relationship between morocco and the european union must therefore be seriously damaged.
well, then, morocco-european union relations must be seriously affected.
---------------------------
in the fisheries sector, adaptation to an economy of global scale would have different effects.
adaptation to a global economy has had varying effects on the fisheries sector.
---------------------------
like any other economic activity, the globalisation also affects fisheries.

but i can already see that you, too, are in favour of a more resolute approach here.
---------------------------
i have a need for discussion on three points in the report.
i think that we need further discussion on three points in the report.
---------------------------
that would be counterproductive, both for fisheries resources and for jobs.
that would be counterproductive, both for fish stocks and for jobs.
---------------------------
fishing must be able to stand on its own feet.
fisheries needs to stand on their own two feet.
---------------------------
secondly, i would like to refer to the wto negotiations that you have mentioned

the strengthening of the governing apparatus should be at the heart of this.

---------------------------
in many respects, particularly in the financial and educational sectors, the state is not working sufficiently
the state is functioning ineffectively in very many ways, especially in the finance and education sectors.

the financial resources are often only provided with considerable delays or sometimes not at all.

the delegation is too little involved in the drawing up of the programme.
the delegation is not sufficiently involved in defining the programme.

it is too early for such a statement.
it is too early to say.

secondly, depleted uranium is not a natural or less radioactive
my second point is that depleted uranium is not a naturally occurring substance, as people would have us believe, or a less radioactive one.
---------------------------
it is about 20% less radioactive than natural uranium.
it is approximately 20% less radioactive than natural uranium.
---------------------------
it is a waste product of the nuclear industry and must also be treated as such.
it is a by-product of nuclear processing and must accordingly be treated as waste.

finally, i would like to make a final comment.
i should like to end with one last comment.
---------------------------
i hope you understand, because i have spoken for quite a long time.
please excuse me for going on a little too long.

mr solana, the purpose never harmed the funds.
mr solana, i must tell you that the end does not justify the means.

firstly, the humanitarian dimension of the problem.
there is, firstly, the human aspect of the problem.

this applies to armed forces and to a large part of the civilian population.
these people include military personnel and many civilians.

in the balkans, we are clearly faced with such a situation.

no, from a european point of view, the purpose must not be to cut the money

consequently, the risks associated with the use of the gulf war were known.

why would the soldiers not be warned?
if so, why were soldiers not given warnings in a similar way?

we know that the number of leukaemia deaths among our soldiers is exceptionally high.
all we know is that the incidence of leukaemia among our soldiers is abnormally high.
---------------------------
we do not agree with a moratorium.
we do not support the call for a moratorium.
---------------------------
this would be a wrong debate.
it would be inappropriate to engage in such a debate.
---------------------------
the political debate is in danger of going beyond a dispute between scientists.
there is the risk that in this way, the political debate tips over into a scientific one.
---------------------------
firstly, the european union has responsibility for the people on the ground.
first of all, the european union s responsibility is towards the local population.
---------------------------
it is up to the member states to assume responsibility for their soldiers.
it is up to the member states to assume responsibility for their soldiers.

the increased number of deaths can certainly have other causes.
there might well be other causes for the increased number of fatalities.

it is therefore very good that this parliament is dealing with this issue today.
that is why it is very gratifying that parliament is dealing with this issue today.

i thank the high representative, who has promised us complete information and transparency.

a violent conflict is always under the ban on maintaining proportionality of resources.
an armed conflict must always be governed by the precept that no more force may be used than is necessary to achieve the military objective.

we will have to talk about the rapid intervention forces on the next item.
we have as our next point for discussion the issue of a rapid reaction force.
---------------------------
i therefore reiterate my promise to inform you of everything i am going to do.
i therefore once again promise to provide all the information i can.

i will be unable to provide you with information that we do not have informally.
it would be rather difficult to provide you with information we do not have.

there have been many things that are all very interesting.
a great many things have been said, all very interesting.
---------------------------
but i would like to mention a few things that have been addressed to avoid misgiving
i would, however, like to respond to some of the statements that have been made in order to prevent any misunderstandings.
---------------------------
i would like to make two reflexes of almost personal nature.
i have two observations which are almost personal observations.
---------------------------
firstly, i am very much a different person from the objectives and the means.
firstly, i make a very clear distinction between ends and means.
---------------------------
i do not want to be told that i would cross targets and resources.
i would not like to be accused of confusing the ends with the means.
---------------------------
the resources and their knowledge change with time.
different means, and our assessment of them, change over time.
---------------------------
i would therefore like to say that i do not confuse objectives and resources.
i would therefore like to make it clear that that i am not confusing ends with means.
---------------------------
i have never done so and i do not want to do so in the future.
i have never done so and i would hope never to do so.
---------------------------
this does not mean using parliament or making it a co-defendeur.
that does not mean i am using parliament or making it complicit.
---------------------------
but i must ask you to take your responsibilities.
what i need to do is to ask you to accept your own responsibility.
---------------------------
i accept it and you must accept it.
i am accepting mine and you must accept yours.
---------------------------
that does not mean making someone a co-detain.
that is not making anybody complicit.
---------------------------
we must be able to share our views and take community responsibility.
we must be able to share and to accept our collective responsibility.
---------------------------
that would be all.
i have nothing else to say.

it was obviously blocked by the french presidency without a reason for that.
it was blocked, it appears, by the french presidency, with no explanation of what was happening.
---------------------------
this proposal should apply the codecision procedure, but that is not the case.
it should, of course, be codecision, but it is not.
---------------------------
we therefore have an effective veto instrument.
so we have an effective veto.
---------------------------
so the many amendments from the committee are so.
hence the many amendments proposed by the committee.
---------------------------
i am from this party because it is now completely opposed to europe.
that was the party which i felt obliged to abandon because it had become totally negative about europe.
---------------------------
this trend is continuing with this proposal for the special facility.
this trend is continued by the current proposal for the rapid reaction facility.
---------------------------
so far, so good.
so far, so good.

but the necessary resources must be put under heading iv of the financial perspective.
but the funds for this purpose must be allocated under heading 4 of the financial perspective.
---------------------------
there is no need for a weiss ability to predict similar events this year.
we have no need of a crystal ball to predict a similar situation this year.
---------------------------
if this is not possible, a revision should be made.
should that be impossible, provision must be made for a revision of the financial perspective.
---------------------------
we also want parliament to be consulted on every measure.
in addition, we want an obligation to consult parliament on each action to be financed under the facility.
---------------------------
the rapporteur and the committee responsible have followed these budgetary aspects.
the rapporteur and the lead committee have complied with these budgetary wishes.
---------------------------
we thank you very much for that.
for this we are very grateful to them.
---------------------------
in particular, it was alleged that excessively restrictive structures should be maintained or implemented.
particular efforts have been made to avoid introducing or maintaining superfluous structures which delay the decision-making process.
---------------------------
on some points, my group draws the commission text forward with the rapporteurs amendments.
my group prefers the commission text to the rapporteur s amendments on a number of scores.
---------------------------
anyone who knows may also be able to continue to coordinate and guide in the long term.
who knows whether more far-reaching coordination and guidance will be possible in the time to come.
---------------------------
we learn by falling and reluctance.
we learn from our knock-backs, albeit with some delay.
---------------------------
in this respect, the special capacity for crisis intervention represents a huge step forward.
the rapid reaction facility is, as far as this is concerned, an enormous step forward.
---------------------------
our group will also support this amendment.
our group will, incidentally, support that amendment.
---------------------------
it is a clear choice, with our explicit preference, to use civil instruments in dangerous conflict
it is our express preference to deploy civil instruments first in the event of a threatening conflict situation.
---------------------------
we want balanced eu efforts in the non-military and military crisis management.
we would like to see a balance struck between the eu efforts in the fields of civil and military crisis management.
---------------------------
simple procedures are therefore proposed for the special capacity for crisis intervention.
this is why simple procedures are being proposed for the rapid reaction facility.

comitology can be avoided by respecting the community framework.
comitology can be avoided by remaining within the community framework.

we are also very keen to see how the echo programme will behave.
in this context, we are also very keen to find out how the facility will relate to the echo programme.
---------------------------
we are debating a new instrument for educating children.
this is a new instrument, and we can learn from its growing pains.
---------------------------
it is important to decide, act and finance quickly.
it is about fast decision-making, acting and funding.
---------------------------
i think it is extremely important that our parliament should be fully involved.
it is of utmost importance for our parliament to be totally involved.
---------------------------
will we be informed of the measures planned in good time?
will we be informed about proposed action in good time?
---------------------------
can the commissioner reassure us on this?
can the commissioner give us any reassurance in this respect?
---------------------------
the problem is that it does not even have eimer to fill the water.
the only problem is that it does not even possess buckets with which to draw water.
---------------------------
but the measures before and preventive measures are much more important.
far greater importance surely attaches to action before the event, to preventive measures.
---------------------------
the commissions initiative seems to us to be important.
we consider the commission s initiative to be an important one.
---------------------------
mr president, the debate on the special capacity for crisis intervention is long overdue
mr president, the discussion on the rapid reaction facility is starting to drag.
---------------------------
this mechanism is a matter of necessity for measures within the framework of eu programmes.
this mechanism specifically focuses on actions within the context of european programmes.
---------------------------
on another point, however, i do not agree with the conclusions of the report.
however, i do not share the conclusions of the report on a different score.

article 308 is the only article on which this proposal can be based.
article 308 is the only article on which this proposal can be based.
---------------------------
i believe that parliaments codecision is causing unnecessary delays.
it appears to me that codecision for parliament will delay matters unnecessarily.
---------------------------
but money does not always replace political intentions and political influence.
but money is no substitute for political will and political influence.
---------------------------
and the eu has so far failed to do so.
and this is precisely where the eu has been failing.
---------------------------
we have a problem of image with the conflict partners in the many crisis-ravaged countries
we have an image problem in the eyes of the parties to the numerous conflicts in the world today.
---------------------------
this is not just to be done with new departments and financial plans.
that cannot be surmounted with new administrative units and financial plans alone.
---------------------------
i hope that is the case, and i ask mr patten to confirm
i hope this is the case and i would ask for a reassurance on this point from the commissioner.
---------------------------
this is another issue, however.
this is a separate issue.
---------------------------
the commissions funding capacity should not be confused with these defence issues.
the commissions financial facility should not be mixed up with these defence issues.
---------------------------
secondly, this proposal is a proposal that is a matter of political correctness.
secondly, there is a thread of political correctness running through the proposal.
---------------------------
this is the main reason why we rejected this report.
this is the main reason why we cannot accept this report.
---------------------------
we do not want a european army and a european police force to be right.
we do not want a european army and we certainly to not want a european police force.
---------------------------
these are obviously issues of the first pillar.
these are clearly issues which come under the first pillar.
---------------------------
but how, in what cases?
but how, and in what cases?
---------------------------
what are the ways in which these relations are structured?
what kind of procedures will this relationship employ?
---------------------------
how can we coordinate?
what kind of coordination?
---------------------------
a european special capacity for crisis intervention is completely superfluous and useless for people in crisis
people in crises need a european rapid reaction facility as much as a fish needs a bicycle.
